Making a TIK TAK TOE game!

I Want to be able to write down the entire steps of the game. I also want to see how many functions i should need.


How to play Tik Tak Toe:

1, you are given a 3x3 grid
2, needs two players
3, one player is X
4, second player is O
5, take turns filling each box with respected symbol
6, once a player lines up 3 consecutive symbol diagnally, across or downward a winner is chosen 


thoughts on how to build it 

first make the board
